## 🌸 Project Story

This isn’t just a webpage — it’s a creative collaboration!

My friend designed and painted unique Mandala art keychains.  
To help her share them online, I built this interactive product showcase where users can:

- Browse each keychain with smooth image transitions ✨  
- View multiple angles using a custom-built modal viewer 🔍  
- Enjoy a soothing gradient UI inspired by the colors of Mandala art 🎨  

We also conducted our own **prop photography session** — styling, lighting, and capturing each piece carefully.  
The results were stunning, and the showcase helped sell every single keychain. 💫
