## 🌸 Project Story

This project isn’t just a webpage — it’s a creative collaboration!  

My friend designed and painted **unique Mandala art keychains** and wanted to showcase them to sell directly to friends, family, and college peers — without the hassle of listing them on e-commerce platforms.  

To help her, I built this **interactive product showcase** that highlights the beauty of each keychain. Users can:  

- Browse each keychain with smooth image transitions ✨  
- View multiple angles using a custom-built modal viewer 🔍  
- Enjoy a visually soothing gradient UI inspired by Mandala art 🎨  

We also organized a **prop photography session**, carefully styling and photographing each keychain to make them look their absolute best.  

After creating the webpage, we shared the link with friends, family, and peers — and the result was amazing: **all the keychains were sold within a week!** 💫
